Hello,

We've got a lot of people working on different versions
of our new app for processing customers! People just love
melons! I'm not sure what an &quot;environment&quot; is (sounds like
one of those things lefty nonprofits worry about), but,
according to CTO Today! Magazine, we need to make sure that
developers are setting up their environment correctly
to manage libraries and split up files as needed.

Get up to speed on implementing &quot;virtual environments&quot;
on this project so we don't have any conflicts or missing
requirements. Make sure that you have a .gitignore so your
environment doesn't end up on Github. (Apparently, Github
is a &quot;company&quot;).

We just poached Squysh's 16-year-old wonderkid engineering
manager (Steve Stevenson) to optimize our work process. He says that everyone
should install bpython as well. You won't need it for this project,
but try it out so you know how to do it later. Apparently, you'll use
something called &quot;pip&quot;. But do this inside of your &quot;virtual environment&quot;.
Oh, and my new golf buddy says you should &quot;freeze&quot; this, so someone
else can set things up the same later. <em>Pip</em>? <em>Freeze</em>? <em>Virtual environment</em>?
This all is starting to sound like some sort of science fiction musical,
if you ask me! But we're paying a lot for this advice so make
it happen.

See you next week,

Mel

P.S. I'm not clear what this &quot;virtual environment&quot; is, but
     don't think we're going to buy you any of those fancy
     goggles. All of our discretionary income has gone into
     my new shiny titanium golf clubs.

Oh and make sure you take a look at our app's code.
There is a bug keeping things from working just right.
Someone said it might be an import error, whatever
that means.

<strong>Subject:</strong> One more last thing
<strong>Date:</strong> Wed Sept. 30, 2015 5:59:59 PM PDT

And one last thing,

We're currently running a temporary promotion where
customers are automatically entered into a raffle for a free
melon. As my mother used to say, &quot;The only thing better than
a melon is a FREE MELON!&quot;. Since this isn't a part of our
normal operations, we don't want that code with our regular
scripts.

There's a script in this file (melon_customer_raffle.py)
for processing raw customer info and then choosing a random
customer. Steve started to reorganize the code, but had to
run to a a ping-pong tournament. Please go ahead and finish
splitting the file up into three files:

<strong>customer.py</strong> has already been created and contains our
customer class.

<strong>customer_info.py</strong> has also already been created. It takes
our customer data and creates instances for each customer.

<strong>melon_raffle.py</strong> needs to be created still, and should
randomly select a customer and print their name and contact
information.

<p>Let's hope Mel doesn't have wifi, wherever he's golfing.</p>
<p>To Do:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Download all necessary files from the fellowship website</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Set up a virtual environment</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Activate your virtual environment</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">pip install bpython</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">pip freeze to requirements.txt</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">add env/ (your virtual environment) to .gitignore</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">fix random import error</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">finish splitting melon_customer_raffle.py into different files:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>customer.py</strong> already sets up our Customer class</li>
<li><strong>customer_info.py</strong> already processes our customer data.</li>
<li><strong>melon_raffle.py</strong> still needs to be made and should randomly pick a customer and print that customer's info</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. A file titled &quot;melon_customer_raffle.py&quot; can be found in the usual location for
homework materials on the fellowship site.  It contains the customer class,
customer info function and melon raffle function that will need to be split up
into separate files as per Mel's instructions.</p>
<p>P.P.S. There is preview material in this code, for some of the Classes and Object
Orientation that we'll start covering tomorrow. Don't get caught up in the syntax
for defining the Customer class or for setting up new customers. You don't need
to change anything about the customer.py or customer_info.py files, just read
through them and understand how they're relating to the original
melon_customer_raffle.py file.</p>
